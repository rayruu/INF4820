# INF4820 - Algorithms for artificial intelligence and natural language processing

#### Course content
Foundational theory, with implementation in Common Lisp, concerning general techniques for searching, pattern matching, unification, knowledge representation, parsing and memoisation, with particular weight given to algorithms and data structures for the analysis of natural languages.
#### Learning outcome
After the successful completion of INF4820
- you have a general idea of Natural Language Processing as a sub-problem in Artificial Intelligence.
- you understand and can implement key algorithms in searching weighted solution spaces.
- you can design and realize procedures and data structures that scale to large data volumes.
- you know and can adapt basic techniques of probability estimation and decoding.
- you can use functional decomposition and dynamic programming in your own implementation.
- you understand the historic role of Common Lisp in the evolution of programming languages.
